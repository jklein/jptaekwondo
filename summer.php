            <u>Information about the Summer Program:</u><br />
            This intensive program would satisfy students who are looking for an in-depth
            training in Taekwondo. Each session would last for 2 weeks, and we will evaluate at
            the end of the session for belt upgrade. The table below lists the class descriptions
            and schedules.
