                    <h4>We look to Nature for our inspiration, and we strive to manifest its essence
                        and spirit through taekwondo and in our daily lives.</h4>
            </div>
        </section><br />

        <p>As we consider Nature’s various forms, from the towering mountain peak and the blazing
            lightning bolt to the soft rain drops and the warm summer breeze,
            we perceive the natural elements to have simplicity, practicality, speed, harmony, and beauty.</p>

        <p>As a result, we aim to express and manifest the essence of Nature through taekwondo.
            On one level, this means that many of the punches, blocks, and forms that we teach
            resemble elements from Nature, such as water, mountain, and thunder.
            On a more meaningful level, we hope to instill in our students the values that we can glean from Nature:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>From its integration of simplicity, practicality, speed, harmony,
                and beauty into the natural environment, we see the values of balance and moderation.</li>
            <li>From its force and strength, we realize the importance of determination and resolve.</li>
            <li>From the sentiment of awe that is elicited when we stand before Nature,
                we learn the virtues of humility and respect.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We do not believe that taekwondo is confined to the walls of our studio – it is a way of
            life that we hope our students will apply in their daily lives. As life can be
            hectic, complicated, and stressful, we hope that our responses to these realities
            will be that of finding balance, channeling our mental willpower to overcome
            challenges and obstacles, and pursuing choices that are respectful to ourselves and others.</p>

        <p>In essence, we believe that taekwondo is a manifestation of Nature, daily life in
            modern society, and the virtues that encompass a meaningful life.</p>
