        <p class="center_paragraph">We teach a type of taekwondo
        that is one of the most popular
        and is overseen by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kukkiwon">Kukkiwon</a>
        (World Taekwondo
        Headquarters) and the World
        Taekwondo Federation. This form
        of taekwondo is officially
        supervised by South Koreaâ€™s
        Ministry of Culture, Sports and
        Tourism and is what you see at
        the World Taekwondo
        Championships and at the
        Olympics.</p>

    <div class="row">
        <p>One of the benefits of being taught a form of taekwondo that is standardized, popular, and
        widespread is that wherever you go, you are bound to find a studio or gym that teaches Kukkiwon/WTF taekwondo.
        So, whether you are moving to or from a different city or country, you can always
        pick up where you left off.</p>

        <p>We are particularly unique when compared to other taekwondo studios because of our access to
        cutting-edge information on taekwondo. Kukkiwon established the Research Institute of Taekwondo
        in 2006 and the Kukkiwon Scientific Journal in 2010 after systematically updating its taekwondo
        curriculum in order to further develop, research, and disseminate the academic science of taekwondo.
        Master Jang has been certified by Kukkiwon, served on its Technical Expert Committee, and continues
        to maintain connections with high-ranking committee members, which means that we are able to
        offer our students the most advanced form of taekwondo to date.</p>
